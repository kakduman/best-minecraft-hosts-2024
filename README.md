# Best Minecraft Hosting Services of 2024

For the past six years, I’ve operated a Minecraft server (AcornMC) and thoroughly researched the best hosting services. This article is free from monetary interests or affiliate links, focusing solely on the hosts I believe are the best in Minecraft hosting. The motivation for this article stems from the observation that many popular sources prioritize hosts offering the highest affiliate payments, leading to intensely biased rankings. I aim to provide an analysis free of monetary bias and affiliate links, highlighting hosts for their performance, credibility, support, and pricing.

Unlike typical rankings, this review categorizes Minecraft hosts based on their specific strengths and unique offerings. The hosts featured here are those I personally endorse, all providing access to Aikar’s Flags for optimized memory usage and public node statistics for transparency. My evaluations cover the categories of Best Value, Best Performance, Best Custom Features, Best Budget Host, and Best Support.

Our in-depth analysis is below. At a glance, we conclude:

- **[Birdflop](https://www.birdflop.com) (~$1.70/GB):** Best Value, Best Performance (Tie)
- **[Bloom Host](https://bloom.host) (~$2.63/GB):** Best Custom Features, Best Performance (Tie)
- **[PebbleHost](https://www.pebblehost.com) ($1/GB):** Best Budget Hosting (Tie), Best Support
- **[EnviroMC](https://enviromc.host) ($1/GB):** Best Budget Hosting (Tie)

# [Birdflop Hosting](https://www.birdflop.com): Best Value, Best Performance (Tie)

- **$1.58/GB RAM (EU), $1.95/GB RAM (US)**
- Overall, Birdflop provides great performance at a great cost point — perhaps at the cost of custom features. Recommended for budgets $8-$40/mo.

[Birdflop](https://www.birdflop.com) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that specializes in providing accessible hosting and public resources as part of its mission to promote interest in computer science and technology. The general hosting principle of Birdflop, where clients share a dedicated server and split the costs, while Birdflop facilitates this without taking a cut, is similar to the concept of a “cooperative” or “co-op”. In a cooperative, members share resources or costs for mutual benefit, often with an emphasis on community and shared goals, rather than profit-making. Birdflop invests all excess profit back into the client experience. I use Birdflop for hosting AcornMC.

Birdflop also creates and maintains many public resources, including the popular RGB gradient website **[RGBirdflop](https://www.birdflop.com/resources/rgb)** and a **[Discord bot](https://github.com/birdflop/botflop)** that calculates optimizations for your Minecraft server.

> Birdflop’s most popular public resources include RGBirdflop, a website that calculates RGB gradients for Minecraft text, and the Birdflop Bot, a Discord bot that analyzes Timings reports and Spark profiles to automatically find optimizations for your Minecraft server.

## Specifications

Birdflop plans cost ~$1.58-$1.95/GB RAM for the fastest servers on our list.

Birdflop has plans in the US (New York) and the EU (Germany), using high-end Ryzen 9 CPUs for each location. All plans come with 4 CPU threads, 3 off-site backups, a dedicated IP on 8GB+ plans, and a 3-day satisfaction guarantee. The US and EU plans differ in a few technical specifications and their prices.

**The specifications for US hosting (~$1.95/GB) are:**

- Ryzen 9 3900XT
- Up to 200GB NVMe SSD storage

**The specifications for EU hosting (~$1.58/GB) are:**

- Ryzen 9 5950X
- Unmetered NVMe SSD storage

Birdflop’s pricing structure is also non-traditional, meaning it’s hard to say how much the plans cost. EU plans are capped at $2/GB RAM, and US plans are capped at $3/GB RAM. Clients pay these rates and are later reimbursed quarterly, effectively lowering rates at the end of the quarter and making the prices for Birdflop decrease significantly in the long term. For instance, clients were recently reimbursed for Q4 2023, effectively lowering EU rates to $1.88/GB with a 6% reimbursement, while US rates decreased to $1.95/GB with a 35% reimbursement.

### Key Positives: Performance, Value

Birdflop’s offer is made extremely unique by their offering of 4 CPU threads, the most of any host on this list, and also the maximum number of threads that Java Minecraft servers can generally take advantage of. Birdflop can also boost your CPU thread access temporarily during periods of high demand. Due to its high CPU thread count, in addition to its usage of solely high-end CPUs, we give Birdflop the award for **best performance**.

Birdflop’s 501(c)(3) status also provides Birdflop with the award of **best value**, since clients are reimbursed for excess profit. Effectively, clients share hardware and split the costs with each other, with Birdflop acting as a facilitator. Birdflop is the only host that can afford to make 0 profit from its hosting plans, so it’s hard to compete with it.

Birdflop’s **unmatched transparency** helps to reach this conclusion. Birdflop publishes comprehensive live node statistics on its website, along with a quarterly financial breakdown to show people how their money is being used and distributed. As a nonprofit, it also has obligations to file public annual financial reports to the IRS.

### Considerations: Limited Staff

As mentioned earlier, Birdflop has **no official employees**, and it is the smallest host on our list. With its limited number of volunteer staff, it may take a while for staff to respond to tickets, depending on who is awake and available when you create tickets. As an additional symptom of its staffing shortage, some custom features are not available on Birdflop, such as a one-click modpack installer. If you are looking to install modpacks but do not feel comfortable learning how to do it yourself, you may want to consider a different host.

# [Bloom Host](https://bloom.host): Best Custom Features, Best Performance (Tie)

- **$2.25 — $3/GB RAM**
- Bloom’s high-end features can make the service prohibitively expensive.
- Bloom provides great performance, particularly at higher price points, and the ability to split servers to easily run networks. However, support may be limited. Recommended for budgets $30-$80/mo.

[Bloom Host](https://bloom.host) is a moderately-sized high-end host specializing in “dedicated resources,” a system that involves subdividing larger servers into smaller chunks that have resources that only YOU can use. Most hosts will pack clients on shared resources, meaning another customer’s server could be impacting your own server’s performance. While hosts can control this by simply not overselling, having dedicated resources acts as an assurance that your node will not be overloaded, and your server will perform near its full potential 24/7. Additionally, Bloom seamlessly integrates dedicated resources with its custom features — offering features like a server splitter, a feature that allows you to run multiple servers on just one plan by sharing resources among the servers.

> Bloom’s server splitter allows you to distribute your dedicated resources among multiple servers

## Specifications

Bloom has plans in Virginia, Texas, California, Florida, Germany, and Singapore, using high-end Ryzen 9 CPUs for each location. All plans come with 3 off-site backups and a dedicated IP on 8GB+ plans. The plans are subdivided into three tiers, though we will only be covering the two tiers with dedicated resources, as only these two tiers grant full access to Bloom’s custom features and therefore Bloom’s full potential.

**The specifications for Performance hosting ($2.25/GB) are:**

- Ryzen 9 3900/3950X
- 120–480GB NVMe SSD storage

**The specifications for Performance+ hosting ($3.00/GB) are:**

- Ryzen 9 5950X
- 150–600GB NVMe SSD storage

Bloom uniquely scales other resources with the amount of RAM purchased, granting an additional 60GB (Performance) or 100GB (Performance+) of storage and 1 additional thread per 4GB RAM purchased. So, while an 8GB Performance+ plan ($24/mo) has 2 dedicated CPU threads, a 16GB Performance+ plan ($48/mo) has 4 dedicated threads.

### Key Positives: Performance, Custom Features, Locations

The mentioned increase in dedicated threads with RAM allows Bloom to excel, particularly at larger, more expensive plans. For this reason, I recommend Bloom to players who may be hosting large networks with large budgets. With the additional ability to split servers, Bloom is perfect for large networks that could be cumulatively using 24+ GB RAM. At these scales, Bloom wins the award for **best performance**.

The server-splitting custom feature, along with many other custom features in the panel, is truly useful for anyone. The server-splitting feature can be used by smaller servers when an administrator or developer wants to spin up a test server or an events server, and large networks can use the feature long-term to seamlessly integrate their network across the same hardware. These features are hard to find on any host, giving Bloom the award for **best custom features**.

Finally, Bloom’s varied locations have it placed first for **most global coverage**, though this is an unofficial category as one location in North America and one in Europe is generally sufficient. With 4 locations in the US, 1 in the EU, and 1 in Singapore, Bloom sufficiently covers the most popular Minecraft hosting locations.

### Considerations: Prohibitively Expensive

Bloom provides high-quality resources, but these resources come with a high price that may be **prohibitively expensive** for many. Ultimately, users working with a budget of under $25/mo or prioritizing sheer performance per dollar may want to choose a different host.

# [PebbleHost](https://pebblehost.com): Best Budget Host (Tie), Best Support

- **$1/GB RAM for budget hosting**
- PebbleHost budget servers are exceedingly slow, but their low price point and comprehensive support make them an excellent choice for budgets $1-$5/mo.

[PebbleHost](https://pebblehost.com) is the largest host covered in this article and a host that most players have probably heard of. In some ways, it bears the red flags of the hosts I mentioned in the introduction to this article: Pebble spends a lot on advertisements, and their premium plans seem oversold, expensive, or generally disreputable. However, PebbleHost budget hosting is nearly unparalleled, and we will only cover these plans in this article. PebbleHost walks newbies through setting up their first server and getting them started with running it. The price paid for the server is more than worth it from the comprehensive staff support alone. I opened a support ticket at 3 AM Eastern Time and documented my experience:

> “Hello, how much can Pebble help with setting up a modded server for someone who has no knowledge?”

**David from PebbleHost:**

> “Hello, our support varies depending on what you need, For budget servers we have a lot of useful guides, I have attached 2 of the basic starting ones below.
>
> - [How to Install a Minecraft Modpack](https://help.pebblehost.com/en/minecraft/how-to-install-a-minecraft-modpack)
> - [How to Install Forge to Your Server](https://help.pebblehost.com/en/minecraft/how-to-install-forge-to-your-server)
>
> For Premium servers we have preinstall’s available that will basically handle the above guides for you in just a couple of clicks, simply select the modpack you wish to have installed and run it. You can see our available preinstalls on the JAR & preinstalls demo page here: https://demo.pebblehost.com/server/303413
>
> If you run into errors or issues we’re typically happy to assist you debugging them, although please do note that we do not provide support in any capacity for installing custom mod-packs that you have made yourself not available on curseforge.”

## Specifications

PebbleHost has plans in Canada and France using older CPUs for each location. The specifications are:

- Intel Xeon E5–1630v3 / i7–7700k
- Unmetered SSD storage

Pebble’s servers are pretty lackluster. While the 7700k may be an alright CPU for Minecraft, Pebble overloads these CPUs, restricting you from obtaining the full potential of the server hardware. Still, it should be sufficient for learning how to get a Minecraft server started or starting a small one for yourself and your friends.

### Key Positives: Support

If you’re just starting a Minecraft server and have no experience, **support** is the most important resource. From this perspective, Pebble’s resources outperform every other host on this list. While similar support may be available at other hosts, Pebble’s $1/GB RAM offer is unbeatable. Pebble’s comprehensive knowledgebase, alongside its 24/7 support team, ensures that you can keep learning about running your Minecraft server whenever you want. You can also use the knowledgebase without being a PebbleHost customer.

PebbleHost’s superior support lends itself as the perfect Minecraft host for people looking for a small and introductory **budget server**.

### Considerations: Slow hardware

PebbleHost’s hardware is **slow and/or overloaded** across all of its plans, and it may not be sustainable if you are aiming to expand your server quickly. This may not be a consideration if you are just starting or running a small one for friends.

# [EnviroMC](https://enviromc.host): Best Budget Host (Tie)

- **$1/GB RAM for budget hosting**
- EnviroMC offers decent performance at a budget price, perhaps at the cost of great support. Recommended for budgets $1-$10/mo.

[EnviroMC](https://enviromc.host) is a small carbon-neutral Minecraft host providing users with the latest-generation servers at a fraction of the expected price. Both budget and premium services from EnviroMC perform phenomenally, and I can fully endorse either. We will be focusing primarily on budget hosting for this article, as Enviro’s budget hosting has no reasonable competition: it is solidly the best in its niche.

### Specifications

EnviroMC has locations in Virginia and Germany using latest-generation CPUs for each location. EnviroMC offers a Budget plan and a Premium plan with different specifications.

**Budget hosting ($1/GB) has specifications of:**

- Ryzen 5 7600 or Intel i9–9900k
- Unmetered NVMe SSD storage
- 5 off-site backups

An upgrade to the **Premium plans ($2.50/GB)** allows for:

- Ryzen 9 7950X or 7950X3D
- Unmetered NVMe SSD storage (no change)
- DDR5 Memory
- 14 off-site backups

### Key Positives: Performance, Price

EnviroMC offers **top hardware** for budget plans, though speeds may be inherently limited by its low CPU thread allocation, which varies from 1 CPU thread to 4+ depending on the amount of RAM purchased. If you are already aware of the logistics of setting up a Minecraft server and are just looking to host a smaller budget server, EnviroMC is likely to be a perfect fit for you. No other host can compete with EnviroMC’s budget performance. The additional potential to upgrade to the premium plan if the server grows also allows some freedom in what you may want to do with your server.

$1/GB is additionally on the lowest-end for budget hosts, as credit card transaction fees and support times become considerable costs at prices this low. EnviroMC therefore ties Pebble in its budget host costs.

### Considerations: Support

Many customers for budget plans may rely heavily on support, especially if they are just starting. EnviroMC staff support may have limited availability compared to some alternatives.
